# CryptoAnalysis
## Marc S. and Kevin Z.

We did an analysis of some of the top 100 bitcoins and their progress throughout the past year. We split the top 100 bitcoins into 5 subgroups depending on where they were in the ranking. An analysis was performed on the daily price changes and attempted to see if there were any correlations between the sub-groups. This was mainly done through a dataframe from the pandas library and our data was obtained through the Alpha Vantage API and scraped from coinmarketcap.com.
